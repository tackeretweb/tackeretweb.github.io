The bad website that I found is Suzanne Collins website. As soon as you open the web page, it looks very simple and 
fanmade. I am suprised because she is a succesful writer but her website doesn't show that. Compared to other websites this one 
looks older and not organized. The website uses HTML 4.01. There are tables, but it is used across the whole page on the works
page as a way to order the books. Looking at all the other pages shows that the other pages follow this same design. I would 
have done something similar to our Nature project where we used figures to separate images. The layout does not make sense to me because
the welcome is on the left side and it is smaller than everything else, the selected works to the right are misplaced and hard to 
read. Also, the quick links are underneath the selected works which makes it hard to find or notice. I would change the placement
of some of this stuff and have the welcome page separate from the novels. I would also make an unordered list for the header pages 
so they can be moved across the page and I would add a nav to make them more interesting and engaging. A background color 
for the whole website would be nice, instead of just of a white bakcground, because the white pops out and doesn't make it look professional. I noticed that when you try 
to make the page smaller it does not change, it stays in the same place. It is not mobile friendly. There are no col tags, I think there 
should be because there could be more color and make the tables more engaging. None of the colors on the page work together. Along with a change in color, I 
think changing the font would help. The font is mostly Times New Roman, which while is easy to read, with the way this website is laid out it doesn't match 
and once again makes it look outdated. There is no copyright, the pages mostly just end with the content. One of the big things that pops out, 
is how the images don't align with the words and the scrolling takes up too much space. In all, Suzanne Collins website is outdated and needs 
some changes in order to be a professional writer's website.

Since I looked at a bad website for a writer, I decided to look at two good writer's websites. The first one is J.K 
Rowling's website. Right away, her website looks more modern. I love how the first page is just for the welcome and there are current news 
for what is happening in her life and with her books. I also love how if you click on the background image where her Twitter is shown, it takes 
you to her actual Twitter. The more you click on the image the more pages it takes you to. I did not find any col tags on this website either, but 
it is able to get away with it. This code is way more clean, there is a lot more separation between tags and it uses way less divs. I think it is nice 
how her signature is at the bottom along with the copyright. It makes the website appear finished and clean. Her website feels very complete, with 
Suzanne Collins, I felt like parts were missing and it was hard to read the code, but with Rowling's it is clear where stuff is and where I can find the 
information that I need. The pictures are engaging and fit very well with the background. The background is a nice color and it creates a good contrast between 
the images and text to itself. One thing I might change is the font, it's not bad, but I feel there could be other ones that would fit nicely with the feel of the 
website. This is a very well done website especially for the target audience, it has some suprises but is also very informative.

The other good website I looked at is David Sedaris's. While his webisite does have a white background, it fits because it fits with the theme, which is modern and clean. 
I like how the first thing we see is his new book, it gets people to look at it and read the description. This code uses a lot of div's like Collins did, but on Sedaris's website
they have purpose and make the page easy to read. One interesting extra thing is at the bottom you can enter your email address and stay updated with everything. 
His page does have a copyright. One thing I would change is the same picture is used on Bio and Tour, I think a different image would be helpful because I was clicking 
between the two and I wasn't sure if the page wasn't loading or not. I really like the header class and how simple it is because I am more focused on the actual content rather
than the fancy coding. I also did not find any cod tags on this website either. Both Rowling and Sedaris's headers include an ul, which compared to Collins, makes it more spread out 
and fit with the layout of the page. I like how in Sedaris's, the pages are capitalized. It helps draw attention to them and fits with the theme.

In all, I which Collins had a better website because her content could have such a good theme and it would appear more professional. It was fun to go through 
the good websites because there were extra things that made them special, but still look professional and fit them as writers and people.
